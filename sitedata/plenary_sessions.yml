  abstract: |
    In recent years, we have seen tremendous advances in the field of natural language processing through the
    use of neural networks. In fact, they have done so well, that they have almost succeeded in rewriting the field as we knew it.
    In this talk, I examine the state of the field and its link to the past, with a focus on language generation of many forms.
    I ask where neural networks have been particularly successful, where approaches from the past might still be valuable, and where
    we need to turn in the future if we are to go beyond our current success. To answer these questions, this talk will feature clips
    from a series of interviews I carried out with experts in the field.

  presenter: Prof. Josh Tenenbaum

  abstract: |
    Humans learn language building on more basic conceptual and computational resources that we can already see
    precursors of in infancy.  These include capacities for causal reasoning, symbolic rule formation, rapid
    abstraction, and commonsense representations of events in terms of objects, agents and their interactions.
    I will talk about steps towards capturing these abilities in engineering terms, using tools from hierarchical
    Bayesian models, probabilistic programs, program induction, and neuro-symbolic architectures.
    I will show examples of how these tools have been applied in both cognitive science and AI contexts, and point
    to ways they might be useful in building more human-like language, learning and reasoning in machines.
  bio: |
    Josh Tenenbaum is Professor of Computational Cognitive Science at MIT in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, 
    the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM). 
    He received his PhD from MIT in 1999, and taught at Stanford from 1999 to 2002. His long-term goal is to reverse-engineer
    intelligence in the human mind and brain, and use these insights to engineer more human-like machine intelligence.  His 
    current research focuses on the development of common sense in children and machines, the neural basis of common sense, 
    and models of learning as Bayesian program synthesis. His work has been published in Science, Nature, PNAS, and many 
    other leading journals, and recognized with awards at conferences in Cognitive Science, Computer Vision, Neural Information 
    Processing Systems, Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making, and Robotics. He is the recipient of the Distinguished 
    Scientific Award for Early Career Contributions in Psychology from the American Psychological Association (2008), the 
    Troland Research Award from the National Academy of Sciences (2011), the Howard Crosby Warren Medal from the Society of 
    Experimental Psychologists (2016), the R&D Magazine Innovator of the Year award (2018), and a MacArthur Fellowship (2019). 
    He is a fellow of the Cognitive Science Society, the Society for Experimental Psychologists, and a member of the American 
    Academy of Arts and Sciences.
