    Birds of a feather meetups help junior researchers or researchers attending EMNLP
    for the first time strike up conversations with other researchers in their areas
    of interest. This can also be a good avenue for junior researchers to get feedback
    on ongoing ideas and learn about relevant ongoing projects at other groups/universities
    and facilitate more exchange of research ideas, and collaborative discussions.
