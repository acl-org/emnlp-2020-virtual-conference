      Natural Language Processing (NLP) research at Google focuses on algorithms that apply at scale, across languages, and
      across domains. Our systems are used in numerous ways across Google, impacting user experience in search, mobile, apps,
      ads, translate and more.

      Our work spans the range of traditional NLP tasks, with general-purpose syntax and semantic algorithms underpinning
      more specialized systems. We are particularly interested in algorithms that scale well and can be run efficiently in a
      highly distributed environment.

      Our syntactic systems predict part-of-speech tags for each word in a given sentence, as well as morphological features
      such as gender and number. They also label relationships between words, such as subject, object, modification, and others.
      We focus on efficient algorithms that leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, and recently have incorporated neural net technology.

      On the semantic side, we identify entities in free text, label them with types (such as person, location, or organization),
      cluster mentions of those entities within and across documents (coreference resolution), and resolve the entities to
      the Knowledge Graph.

      To learn more about the research we’re presenting at EMNLP 2020, please visit our [Google at EMNLP 2020 website](https://goo.gle/EMNLPhomepage).

      Artificial intelligence could be one of humanity's most useful inventions. DeepMind aims to build advanced AI to expand our knowledge and find solutions to thousands of problems.

      We’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.

      We have a track record of breakthroughs in fundamental AI research, published in journals like Nature, Science, and more. Our programs have learned to diagnose eye diseases as effectively as the world’s top doctors, to save 30% of the energy used to keep data centres cool, and to make state of the art predictions of the complex 3D shapes of proteins - which could one day transform how drugs are invented.

      DeepMind was founded in London in 2010, and we joined forces with Google in 2014 to accelerate our work. Since then, our community has expanded to include teams in Alberta, Montreal, Paris, and Mountain View in California.

      There is no AI without algorithms. In our pursuit of fluid intelligence, we are continuing to advance our work in deep learning, and are putting significant investment into neurosymbolic AI, which combines the power of neural networks with symbolic methods to help AI reason more effectively. \n In parallel, we’re delivering secure, trusted AI with work focused on expandability, fairness, and bias reduction, and empowering AI creators with AI engineering tools and capabilities that simplify and automate key tasks like data preparation, training and lifecycle management. \n Finally, we’re developing a new class of AI hardware that is inherently energy-sufficient, increasing compute power by orders of magnitude without the demand for increased energy.

        Facebook AI works with the research community to advance artificial intelligence. Our areas of research cover many fields including but not limited to speech and audio, conversational AI, ranking and recommendations, and computer vision.

        Facebook AI is comprised of two core divisions – fundamental research (FAIR) and applied research. FAIR seeks to further our fundamental understanding in both new and existing domains, covering the full spectrum of topics related to AI, with the mission of advancing the state-of-the-art of AI through open research for the benefit of all. Facebook AI Applied Research engages in cutting-edge research that can improve and power new product experiences at huge scale for our community.

        Facebook AI is built on the key principles of openness, collaboration, excellence, and scale. We believe the latest advancements in AI should be published and open-sourced for the community. We work openly with internal and external partners to collaborate and share knowledge. We believe there is no shortage of new areas to explore in AI, and our researchers focus on the projects we believe will have the most positive impact on society. Finally, our research must account for both large scale data and computation needs in order to bring the benefits of AI to more people and improve accessibility. 

        If our mission and work intrigue you, Facebook AI is always looking to hire the best talent to our globally based teams. For information about open roles and how to apply, please visit [https://ai.facebook.com/join-us/](https://ai.facebook.com/join-us/)

A large part of the slot will be dedicated to questions. We will also present ALPS, an NLP winter school which will take place in the French alps in January 2021. NAVER LABS Europe is the largest French industrial research centre in AI.
