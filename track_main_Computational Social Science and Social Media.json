Semantic augmentation is a potential way to alleviate this problem. Given that rich semantic information is implicitly preserved in pre-trained word embeddings, they are potential ideal resources for semantic augmentation. In this paper, we propose a neural-based approach to NER for social media texts where both local (from running text) and augmented semantics are taken into account. In particular, we obtain the augmented semantic information from a large-scale corpus, and propose an attentive semantic augmentation module and a gate module to encode and aggregate such information, respectively. Extensive experiments are performed on three benchmark datasets collected from English and Chinese social media platforms, where the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach to previous studies across all three datasets.","authors":["Yuyang Nie","Yuanhe Tian","Xiang Wan","Yan Song","Bo Dai"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["named recognition","data problems","semantic augmentation","pre-trained embeddings"],"material":null,"paper_type":"Short","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.107","program":"main","sessions":[{"end_time":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 04:00:00 GMT","hosts":null,"link":"https://www.virtualchair.net/events/emnlp2020","session_name":"g1F","start_time":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 02:00:00 GMT"}],"similar_paper_uids":["main.989","main.911","main.1952","main.2733","main.3635"],"title":"Named Entity Recognition for Social Media Texts with Semantic Augmentation","tldr":"Existing approaches for named entity recognition suffer from data sparsity problems when conducted on short and informal texts, especially user-generated social media content.

Through analyzing a dataset of 80.5M questions across social media, books, and films, we show that individuals employ interpersonal pragmatic moves in their language to align their intimacy with social settings. Then, in three studies, we further demonstrate how individuals modulate their intimacy to match social norms around gender, social distance, and audience, each validating key findings from studies in social psychology.

Further, an encoder-decoder neural framework is employed to  continue the context with a quotation via language generation. Experiment results on two large-scale datasets in English and Chinese demonstrate that our quotation generation model outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Further analysis shows that topic, interaction, and query consistency are all helpful to learn how to quote in online conversations.","authors":["Lingzhi Wang","Jing Li","Xingshan Zeng","Haisong Zhang","Kam-Fai Wong"],"demo_url":"","keywords":["persuasions","automatic generation","language generation","encoder-decoder framework"],"material":null,"paper_type":"Long","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.538","program":"main","sessions":[{"end_time":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 04:00:00 GMT","hosts":null,"link":"https://www.virtualchair.net/events/emnlp2020","session_name":"g4D","start_time":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 02:00:00 GMT"}],"similar_paper_uids":["main.1863","main.1522","main.2444","main.128","main.645"],"title":"Continuity of Topic, Interaction, and Query: Learning to Quote in Online Conversations","tldr":"Quotations are crucial for successful explanations and persuasions in interpersonal communications.
