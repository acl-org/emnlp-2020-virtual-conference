[{"content":{"abstract":"Computational measures of linguistic diversity help us understand the linguistic landscape using digital language data. The contribution of this paper is to calibrate measures of linguistic diversity using restrictions on international travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous work has mapped the distribution of languages using geo-referenced social media and web data. The goal, however, has been to describe these corpora themselves rather than to make inferences about underlying populations. This paper shows that a difference-in-differences method based on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index can identify the bias in digital corpora that is introduced by non-local populations. These methods tell us where significant changes have taken place and whether this leads to increased or decreased diversity. This is an important step in aligning digital corpora like social media with the real-world populations that have produced them.","authors":["Jonathan Dunn","Tom Coupe","Benjamin Adams"],"demo_url":null,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_type":"Workshop","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlpcss-1.1","program":"workshop","sessions":[],"similar_paper_uids":[],"title":"Measuring Linguistic Diversity During COVID-19","tldr":"Computational measures of linguistic diversity help us understand the linguistic landscape using digital language data.

However, this method usually requires high expertise and manual effort because human coders need to read, interpret, and manually annotate text passages. This is especially true if the system of categories used for annotation is complex and semantically rich. Therefore, qualitative content analysis could benefit greatly from automated coding. In this work, we investigate the usage of machine learning-based text classification models for automatic coding in the area of psycho-social online counseling. We developed a system of over 50 categories to analyze counseling conversations, labeled over 10.000 text passages manually, and evaluated the performance of different machine learning-based classifiers against human coders.","authors":["Philipp Grandeit","Carolyn Haberkern","Maximiliane Lang","Jens Albrecht","Robert Lehmann"],"demo_url":null,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_type":"Workshop","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlpcss-1.2","program":"workshop","sessions":[],"similar_paper_uids":[],"title":"Using BERT for Qualitative Content Analysis in Psychosocial Online Counseling","tldr":"Qualitative content analysis is a systematic method commonly used in the social sciences to analyze textual data from interviews or online discussions.

Through longitudinal analysis of each user, we construct emotion transition graphs, observing key transitions between disgust and anger, and self-transitions within anger and disgust emotional states. Observing user patterns through clustering of user longitudinal analyses reveals emotional transitions fall into four main clusters: (1) erratic motion over short period of time, (2) disgust -> anger, (3) optimism -> joy. (4) erratic motion over a prolonged period. Finally, we propose a method for predicting users subsequent topic, and by consequence their emotions, through constructing an Emotion Topic Hidden Markov Model, augmenting emotion transition states with topic information.

To minimize the effect of gender bias in these settings, more insight is needed when it comes to where and how biases manifest themselves in the text corpora employed. This paper contributes by showing how gender bias in word embeddings from Wikipedia has developed over time. Quantifying the gender bias over time shows that art related words have become more female biased. Family and science words have stereotypical biases towards respectively female and male words. These biases seem to have decreased since 2006, but these changes are not more extreme than those seen in random sets of words. Career related words are more strongly associated with male than with female, this difference has only become smaller in recently written articles. These developments provide additional understanding of what can be done to make Wikipedia more gender neutral and how important time of writing can be when considering biases in word embeddings trained from Wikipedia or from other text corpora.","authors":["Katja Geertruida Schmahl","Tom Julian Viering","Stavros Makrodimitris","Arman Naseri Jahfari","David Tax","Marco Loog"],"demo_url":null,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_type":"Workshop","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlpcss-1.11","program":"workshop","sessions":[],"similar_paper_uids":[],"title":"Is Wikipedia succeeding in reducing gender bias?

The second hypothesis is particularly important for theories about contact-induced simplification, since the accommodation to non-natives may explain how the simplification can spread from adult learners to the whole community. To test the hypotheses, I create a very large corpus of native and non-native written speech in four languages (English, French, Italian, Spanish), extracting data from an internet forum where native languages of the participants are known and the structure of the interactions can be inferred. The corpus data yield inconsistent evidence with respect to the first hypothesis, but largely support the second one, suggesting that foreigner-directed speech is indeed simpler than native-directed. Importantly, when testing the first hypothesis, I contrast production of different speakers, which can introduce confounds and is a likely reason for the inconsistencies. When testing the second hypothesis, the comparison is always within the production of the same speaker (but with different addressees), which makes it more reliable.","authors":["Aleksandrs Berdicevskis"],"demo_url":null,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_type":"Workshop","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlpcss-1.18","program":"workshop","sessions":[],"similar_paper_uids":[],"title":"Foreigner-directed speech is simpler than native-directed: Evidence from social media","tldr":"I test two hypotheses that play an important role in modern sociolinguistics and language evolution studies: first, that non-native production is simpler than native; second, that production addressed to non-native speakers is simpler than that addre...","track":"NLP and Computational Social Science (NLP+CSS)"},"id":"WS-18.47","presentation_id":"38940614","rocketchat_channel":"paper-nlpcss-47","speakers":"Aleksandrs Berdicevskis","title":"Foreigner-directed speech is simpler than native-directed: Evidence from social media"},{"content":{"abstract":"Previous English-language diachronic change models based on word embeddings have typically used single tokens to represent entities, including names of people. This leads to issues with both ambiguity (resulting in one embedding representing several distinct and unrelated people) and unlinked references (leading to several distinct embeddings which represent the same person). In this paper, we show that using named entity recognition and heuristic name linking steps before training a diachronic embedding model leads to more accurate representations of references to people, as compared to the token-only baseline. In large news corpus of articles from The Guardian, we provide examples of several types of analysis that can be performed using these new embeddings. Further, we show that real world events and context changes can be detected using our proposed model.","authors":["Felix Hennig","Steven Wilson"],"demo_url":null,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_type":"Workshop","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlpcss-1.19","program":"workshop","sessions":[],"similar_paper_uids":[],"title":"Diachronic Embeddings for People in the News","tldr":"Previous English-language diachronic change models based on word embeddings have typically used single tokens to represent entities, including names of people.

Social media data hold a great deal of promise as a source of information on needs and support-seeking among individuals who are excluded from or systematically prevented from accessing clinical or other institutions ostensibly designed to support them. We apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to more than 3 million Tweets collected from 20,000 Twitter users. We find evidence that women veterans are more likely to use social media to seek social and community engagement and to discuss mental health and veterans\u2019 issues significantly more frequently than their male counterparts. By contrast, male veterans tend to use social media to amplify political ideologies or to engage in partisan debate. Our results have implications for how organizations can provide outreach and services to this uniquely vulnerable population, and illustrate the utility of non-traditional observational data sources such as social media to understand the needs of marginalized groups.","authors":["Kacie Kelly","Alex Fine","Glen Coppersmith"],"demo_url":null,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_type":"Workshop","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlpcss-1.20","program":"workshop","sessions":[],"similar_paper_uids":[],"title":"Social media data as a lens onto care-seeking behavior among women veterans of the US armed forces","tldr":"In this article, we examine social media data as a lens onto support-seeking among women veterans of the US armed forces.

Emoji usage is typically studied in the context of posts made by users, and this view has provided important insights into phenomena such as emotional expression and self-representation. In addition to making posts, however, social media platforms like Twitter allow for users to provide a short bio, which is an opportunity to briefly describe their account as a whole. In this work, we focus on the use of emoji in these bio statements. We explore the ways in which users include emoji in these self-descriptions, finding different patterns than those observed around emoji usage in tweets. We examine the relationships between emoji used in bios and the content of users\u2019 tweets, showing that the topics and even the average sentiment of tweets varies for users with different emoji in their bios. Lastly, we confirm that homophily effects exist with respect to the types of emoji that are included in bios of users and their followers.","authors":["Jinhang Li","Giorgos Longinos","Steven Wilson","Walid Magdy"],"demo_url":null,"keywords":[],"material":null,"paper_type":"Workshop","pdf_url":"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlpcss-1.22","program":"workshop","sessions":[],"similar_paper_uids":[],"title":"Emoji and Self-Identity in Twitter Bios","tldr":"Emoji are widely used to express emotions and concepts on social media, and prior work has shown that users\u2019 choice of emoji reflects the way that they wish to present themselves to the world.
